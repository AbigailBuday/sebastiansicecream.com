										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Summer of Sebastian&#8217;s continues in April! As the temperature continues to heat up, we are debuting all new-flavors for our Fruitsicle Sorbet Bars! We use a selection of local and imported fruits to come up with a range of delicious &amp; exciting flavors. And because they are Sorbet made from nothing but real fruit, cane sugar and filtered water, they are dairy-free and vegan friendly as well. The flavors are as follows (Price: P135 per piece for all flavors):</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3885 size-medium" src="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-300x299.jpg 300w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-1024x1021.jpg 1024w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-768x765.jpg 768w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-1536x1531.jpg 1536w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-600x598.jpg 600w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kamias-Fruitsicle-1.jpg 1806w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>KAMIAS</strong></p>
<p>Known more as an ingredient for savory dishes, the Kamias fruit when mixed with sugar and water can make a delicious refresher with its own flavor notes that set it apart from calamansi juice and lemonade. We take fresh kamias straight from the tree and turn it into a pale green sorbet that tickles your palate with a mixture of sour and sweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-3888 size-medium" src="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-300x299.jpg 300w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-1024x1021.jpg 1024w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-768x765.jpg 768w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-1536x1531.jpg 1536w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-600x598.jpg 600w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buko-Passionfruit-Fruitsicle-1.jpg 1806w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />BUKO PASSION FRUIT</strong></p>
<p>One of our most abundant local fruits are coconuts, bursting with sweet &amp; refreshing buko juice. We tuned fresh Buko juice into a creamy white Buko Sorbet and swirled it with Passionfruit Sorbet made with passionfruit from Davao and the result is a taste combination that is both familiar and adventurous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mangoes and Raspberries are our head Sorbetero&#8217;s two most absolute favorite fruits, and he finally decided to bring them together this summer. Real raspberries spun into a deep red Raspberry Sorbet swirled together with a bright yellow Mango Sorbet made from Fresh local Mangoes at the peak of ripeness. It may be an untraditional combination, but once you taste it you&#8217;ll see why they are our favorite.</p>

<p>One of the best parts about Philippine summers is Melon season, where the markets are full of ripe juicy melons of multiple varieties. We didn&#8217;t know which melon to focus on, so we decided to just use all of them! We take Watermelon, Honeydew Melon and Japanese Melons fresh from the market and turn each of them into sorbets, then we swirl them all together into one beautifully colored Fruitsicle Bar. Keeping the melons separate allows you to taste each melon and savor the complexities of each fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Ice Cream Cake of the Month: PASTILLAS DE LECHE</strong></p>
<p>Also for April, our featured Ice Cream Cake of the Month is Pastillas de leche. Our take on the Mexican Tres Leches, we start with a freshly-baked cake and soak it in a mixture of condensed milk &amp; milk infused with dayap zest. We layer it with freshly spun Condensed Milk Ice Cream and top it with miniature pastillas and a white chocolate drizzle. This moist, sweet cake is a celebration of the delicious Philippine confection made from milk and sugar. Available as a 9-inch whole cake and for the first time, also available in slices for delivery or pick up.<br />
Price: P1650 (whole) and P155 per slice</p>

<p>This Summer of 2021, we are doing our very first ​Summer Of Sebastian&#8217;s ​where for each month of Summer (March, April &amp; May), we will be debuting brand new flavors and novelties.</p>
<p>For March, the first products to be released are the ​Fruity Froya series​. Back in 2010 we released Fro-Ya (short for Frozen Yakult), a sherbet made from the favorite drink (Yakult technically is not an Ice Cream because it lacks the butterfat content). It was an instant hit when it debuted and has become a part of our rotating freezer display. Its&#8217; tart, yogurt-like flavor made it a good match for fruit, so we decided to incorporate fruit sorbet ribbons into it. After testing and tasting several fruits, these are the ones that made the cut:</p>
<p><strong>Mango Fro-Ya</strong> -​ we couldn&#8217;t do this without using Mango, arguably the Philippines&#8217; most celebrated fruit and a perfect match with it&#8217;s bright sweet flavor. We take fresh local mangoes and turn it into a Mango Sorbet that we layer into Fro-Ya. (P135 per scoop, P405 pint)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3791 size-large" src="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-1024x1021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1021" srcset="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-1024x1021.jpg 1024w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-300x299.jpg 300w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-768x765.jpg 768w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-1536x1531.jpg 1536w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-600x598.jpg 600w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango-100x100.jpg 100w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Mango.jpg 1802w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Strawberry Fro-ya</strong> -​ Strawberries are the first fruit that comes to mind when you think of Ice Cream, so we made a Strawberry Sorbet using real strawberries (no syrups, purees, artificial flavors or colors) and layer it into the Fro-Ya (P135 per scoop, P405 pint)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3789 size-large" src="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-1024x1021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1021" srcset="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-1024x1021.jpg 1024w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-300x299.jpg 300w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-768x765.jpg 768w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-1536x1531.jpg 1536w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-600x598.jpg 600w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry-100x100.jpg 100w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Strawberry.jpg 1802w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Blueberry Fro-Ya</strong> -​ Blueberries may not be a local fruit, but Pinoys have wholeheartedly embraced it in the form of blueberry cheesecake, muffins, pancakes and other sweets. The berries&#8217; deep purple color and luscious flavor make a delicious Blueberry Sorbet (no syrups, purees or artificial flavors or colors) that we layer into the Fro-Ya. (P135 per scoop, P405 pint)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3792 size-large" src="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-1024x1021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1021" srcset="https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-1024x1021.jpg 1024w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-300x299.jpg 300w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-768x765.jpg 768w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-1536x1531.jpg 1536w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-600x598.jpg 600w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry-100x100.jpg 100w, https://sebastiansicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUP-FRUIT-Blueberry.jpg 1802w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The Fruity Fro-Ya series comes out March 1, Available in scoops at ​The Podium​ mall and in pints for pick up and delivery at our online store ​sebastiansicecream.com​ and is the first salvo for the Summer of Sebastian&#8217;s. Expect more new products to debut all summer long.</p>
<p>In addition to the Fruity Fro-Ya, our March ​Ice Cream Cake Of The Month​ is the ​<strong>Dark Chocolate Decadence Ice Cream Cake​</strong>, made with layers of freshly baked chocolate cake, Dark Chocolate Ice Cream, garnished with chocolate-covered potato chips, popcorn and pretzels and topped with nut praline and a dark chocolate drizzle. A rich, salty sweet delight for serious chocolate lovers. (P155 per slice, 1,650 for a whole)</p>

<p>During this month of February as our Valentine Flavors are in full swing, we thought it would be fun to look back at the history of Sebastian&#8217;s Valentine Ice Cream collection where what started as a joke between friends eventually became one of our most anticipated (and imitated) events of the year.</p>
<p>Around November 2013, <a href="http://carverhouse.blogspot.com">​Carl Vergara</a>​, a noted comic book writer-artist and playwright who created the Pinoy Superheroine ​<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsazsa_Zaturnnah">Zsa Zsa Zaturnnah</a>​, who was a friend of our head sorbetero, texted him the message &#8220;Your next hit flavor will be called matinong boyfriend&#8221;. Our sorbetero was greatly amused by that and filed the idea away for safekeeping.</p>
<p>When 2014 came along, February was coming up and we were thinking of what to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day, when Vergara&#8217;s suggestion came back to mind. The concept was instantly crystal clear: To name Ice Creams &#8220;Matinong Boyfriend&#8221; and &#8220;Matinong Girlfriend&#8221;, counterprogramming aimed to appeal to the single and unattached on Valentine&#8217;s Day while everyone else was catering to the partnered.</p>
<p>The very first Matinong Boyfriend was Raspberry Sorbet swirled together with Whipped Cream Ice Cream. Raspberries is a personal favorite of ours, both for the flavor and intense color. The very first Matinong Girlfriend was a Dark Chocolate Ice Cream with rum and garnished with cinnamon-roasted almonds and chunks of cookie butter, as cookie butter was the ingredient of the moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even back then, the identities of the 2 flavors were established: &#8220;Boyfriend&#8221; was aimed to appeal to women (and the boys who liked boys), was refined &amp; elegant, with an emphasis on technique and the incorporation of fruit. &#8220;Girlfriend&#8221; was targeted for boys (and the girls who liked girls) had a more masculine energy, celebrating the &#8220;more is more&#8221; aesthetic. These would be the archetypes that would be followed in future Valentines from now on. The Ice Creams came out on February 14 and were an instant hit.</p>
<p>When 2015 rolled around, we considered bringing back the same flavors, But then we thought that would end up being predictable. And since the names had little connection to the flavors themselves, we decided instead to change up the flavors but keep the names.</p>
<p>Matinong Boyfriend was a Passionfruit Sansrival Ice Cream, with passionfruit sorbet and macadamia nuts. We have since brought back this flavor several times (replacing the macadamias with cashews) and it became the first Valentine flavor that would &#8216;cross over&#8217; and become a seasonal flavor. Matinong Girlfriend was a Potato Chip Ice Cream adapting the technique of Cereal Milk but replacing the cornflakes with potato chips. This would be the first time &#8216;Girlfriend&#8217; would start veering to the salty-sweet, snack-inspired flavor profile.</p>

<p>This was also the time we also decided to appeal to the other segment of unattached people; Namely, the ones who had their hearts broken. Either they were looking for answers and in the process of healing, or the ones who were angry with bitterness in their heart and had difficulty moving on</p>
<p>So thus was born the first Closure Ice Cream. Made with chrysanthemum tea flowers and orange zest, this Ice Cream had what would become the defining traits of Closure: Made with tea (symbolizing wellness and healing), no chunks so it would glide smoothly down the palate with minimal effort, and a soothing, rejuvenating flavor.</p>
<p>And of course, the debut of our most INFAMOUS flavor: Unresolved Issues. Using a strong ampalaya tea, we made a bitter sorbet that embodied the sheer bitterness of those unable to move on. To complete the flavor, we threw in some emerald bits of candied ampalaya for color.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unresolved Issues was never meant or expected to sell well, it was meant to be a joke out of a concept that was tongue in cheek to begin with. Most people just tasted it out of curiosity and went off to buy Boyfriend Girlfriend or Closure as expected.</p>
<p>But something interesting happened: In social media, Unresolved Issues was the most consistently shared and talked about flavor of the 4. Mostly from people sharing and saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this is actually a thing&#8221; but as a whole, it elevated the brand and really boosted the Valentine Collection as a whole. We saw that the true value of Unresolved Issues was to grab people&#8217;s attention and have them talk about the brand and share it.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing it on Valentine&#8217;s Day, we released it on Valentine&#8217;s Day weekend to capitalize more on the holiday. Once again, the flavors quickly sold out (except for Unresolved Issues) and the Valentine&#8217;s Ice Cream collection was now officially complete.</p>
<p>In 2016, we finally moved to selling it in the whole month of February as we realized the &#8216;only on Valentine&#8217;s day&#8217; rule was arbitrary and we were letting a lot of potential sales slip away. Matinong Boyfriend this year was a Dulce de Leche Ice Cream with Strawberry Sorbet. This was actually based on a flavor we had done before, but that year we learned how to make our own dulce de leche and wanted to show off this technique. Matinong Girlfriend this year was dark chocolate-covered chicharon and cocoa nibs in Dark Chocolate Ice Cream, and in hindsight this was the year we went a step too far, crossing over from accessible to self-indulgent. For Closure, we finally did our version of Earl Grey Tea, adding orange, lemon and bergamot zest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding Unresolved Issues, we actually considered switching it up and adding some ginger this year, but we realized the best thing we could do was to do absolutely nothing to truly embody the concept of not moving on.</p>

<p>In 2017, Matinong Boyfriend was once again a Raspberry Sorbet ribbon with Bittersweet Chocolate Ice Cream with rum. Looking back we now realize we went to raspberry a lot. Matinong Girlfriend this year was a Cheese Ice Cream with white chocolate-covered Cheetos. The crunchy corn snacks wouldn&#8217;t stay crisp despite a thick coating of white chocolate; so this was ultimately an idea that we had to let go of. But it ended up being reworked into a more successful Cheese Ice Cream in the future. Closure that year was our first time adding fruit to the mix in the form of a Passionfruit Tea Ice Cream with dayap zest.</p>
<p>Unresolved Issues remained unchanged.</p>

<p>In 2018, Matinong Boyfriend was inspired by a Strawberry Shortcake we had in a Japanese-themed cafe, so we made a Sweet Cream Ice Cream blended with Strawberry Sorbet, and the twist was the pound cake being the ripple instead of the sorbet. Trying to make a solid ingredient into a ripple was a bit laborious and we&#8217;re not sure if we&#8217;d do that again over simply incorporating them as chunks. Matinong Girlfriend was a modified S&#8217;more with burnt marshmallows and potato chips in Chocolate Ice Cream. For Closure, we went local by making a Ginger Salabat Ice Cream with local honey.</p>
<p>Unresolved Issues stayed the same.</p>

<p>In 2019, Matinong Boyfriend was an Almond butter-Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with a Blackberry Sorbet ripple. This flavor was inspired by a trip to the mountains where we stayed in a cabin and made chocolate almond spread &amp; blackberry jelly sandwiches. Matinong Girlfriend was a more successful reworking of 2017&#8217;s Cheeto Ice Cream, but this time using mix-ins that were sure to stay crunchy: potato chips, pretzels, and multigrain chips all dipped in salted white chocolate and folded into Cheese Ice Cream. People still ask us about this one and it ended up becoming a seasonal flavor, returning to our displays as Cheesy Munchies Mix. For Closure we made Chai for the first time from scratch, infusing black tea ice cream with peppercorns, cinnamon, gloves ginger, and cardamom.</p>
<p>This may come as a shock, but Unresolved Issues was still the same.</p>

<p>2020 was a theme of looking back. We used to supply Ice Creams to a highly acclaimed Tagaytay restaurant, and these Ice Creams were exclusive to them and never sold at our shop. After a few years, the deal ended and they decided to make their own ice cream. Since it was no longer exclusive, we thought it would be nice to give our regular customers an opportunity to taste these flavors. Creatively speaking, we still personally regard them as some of the finest Ice Creams we have ever put together.</p>
<p>Matinong Boyfriend was Dark Chocolate Orange Ice Cream with rum and candied hazelnuts, while Matinong Girlfriend was Dark Beer Ice Cream made with Cerveza Negra with bittersweet chocolate-covered peanuts. Both Matinong Boyfriend and Girlfriend were from that restaurant. For Closure that year, we decided to go Japanese by making a Roasted Rice Tea.</p>
